# Description

**Noobtest API** is a simple dummy web API with REST type, which will help you learn about testing and use the API.
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or REpresentational State Transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.

Noobtest API is so simple, you can learn how to test "the real API" with this because we provide the method of “CRUD”, Create, Read, Update, and also Delete.

**Don’t worry** about your input requests. After you play with this API, your request will be cleared by the server mechanism (we also hope like that, lol XD).

**Note:** For now we don’t provide/recommend this API for load testing yet, any damage caused by this will be your responsibility.
